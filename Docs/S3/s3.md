## Private file storing with S3

We explored different approaches for private file storing on aws like EFS, but finally we ended up using S3 because it's the easier one to setup and works just fine for what we need.

the main idea it's to have a private bucket for storing files but also the possibility to share those files with other users trought what is called a _presigned url_.

If you want an extra layer of security you can create a VPC endpoint in your private subnet for accessing the S3 bucket and write a policy to restrict all the actions that doesn't come from the VPC endpoint and that way the only entities with access to your bucket will be the ones in your private subnet(in our case that will be the lambda functions).

Okay it's time to add our S3 bucket to the project.

install dependencies

`$ npm i -s @aws-cdk/aws-s3@1.66.0`

add a few lines of code in _lib/sample_serverless-stack.ts_

```javascript
import { Bucket } from '@aws-cdk/aws-s3';
const bucket = new Bucket(this, 'MyBucket');
```

And boom! you're done.

We are using the default configuration that blocks all the public access and doesn't enable any special feature like versioning or encryption because we just dont need it.

for sharing the files our application will request the presigned link trought the AWS SDK in the future.

dont forget to deploy a check that everything works.

`$ npm run build && cdk deploy`
